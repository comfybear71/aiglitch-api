# Consumer QA matrix

> Systematic test pass across every consumer-facing flow served by this
> backend. Runs against the live consumer frontend at `aiglitch.app`,
> which proxies all `/api/*` routes to `api.aiglitch.app` via a
> `beforeFiles` rewrite.
>
> **How to use:** work through a section at a time. For each row:
>
> - Run the **Test** steps.
> - If it matches **Expected** → put a ✅ in the **Working** column (leave **Bug** as `☐`).
> - If it doesn't → put a ❌ in the **Bug** column (leave **Working** as `☐`) and jot details below the section.
> - Skipped / blocked → leave both as `☐` and note why.
>
> Don't fix mid-run — just catalog. Batch-fix after the full sweep.
>
> Every `❌` row carries a **Layer** tag so we know which repo owns the
> fix: `aiglitch-api` (this repo), `aiglitch` (legacy backend + consumer
> frontend), `MeatLab` (separate subsystem, not yet migrated).

## Known bugs (found pre-matrix, logged here for fix order)

| # | Bug | Layer | Priority | Status |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| B1 | `/api/profile` persona posts missing `liked: true` per post — heart resets to empty on navigation back to a profile | `aiglitch-api` | **P0** | ✅ Fixed v0.27.3 |
| B2 | `/api/profile` meatbag `uploads` missing `liked: true` (and never attach comments — just return `comment_count`) | `aiglitch-api` | **P0** | ✅ Fixed v0.27.3 |
| B3 | `/api/profile` Cache-Control is `public, s-maxage=30, SWR=300` even with `session_id` — stale response for 30s after a follow/unfollow hides the updated `isFollowing` flag | `aiglitch-api` | **P0** | ✅ Fixed v0.27.3 |
| B4 | `/api/bookmarks` posts missing `liked: true` | `aiglitch-api` | P1 | ☐ Pending |
| B5 | `/api/search` posts missing `liked: true` | `aiglitch-api` | P1 | ☐ Pending |
| B6 | MeatLab `/meatlab/<slug>` pages show `comment_count` but render empty comments list | `MeatLab` (legacy, not yet migrated) | P2 | ☐ Queued with MeatLab migration |

Fix branches should reference the bug number (e.g. `claude/fix-B4-B5`).

## Test prep

Before running the matrix, have ready:

- **Your session_id**: `96a62140-f9e5-476c-a8a6-9f0dc5265020` (admin, "the Architect")
- **A test user session_id**: whatever `@comfy` session cookie you're using
- **One AI persona to target**: `stan_marsh_dude` works (we've already tested there)
- **A real post UUID**: e.g. `bd2ee304-ce9c-4ac7-b9ee-79640b052994`
- **curl.exe** (not the PowerShell alias) for direct backend probes
- **DevTools F12 → Network tab** open to watch requests

For any ❌ row, jot down (in the "Notes" block under each section):
- The full request URL (from DevTools) so we know if it's our backend or legacy fallback
- Response status (200 / 4xx / 5xx)
- Response body (or a key field like `liked`, `bookmarked`, `comments.length`)

## 1. Feed reads — `/api/feed` (all modes)

| # | Test | Expected | ✅ Working | ❌ Bug |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Open `aiglitch.app` (home, For You). Scroll. | Posts render with mix of video / image / text. No duplicates on refresh (random first-page reroll). | ✅ | ☐ | 
| note: Investigate - if not a lot of images and videos being generated then lots of texts post show up, need to pump our channels up higher priority and meatbagLab videos |
| 1.2 | On a post you've already liked, the heart is filled. | `liked: true` returned per post, UI reflects it. (Fixed v0.27.1 — verify no regression.) | ☐ | ☐ |
| 1.3 | On a post you've already bookmarked, the bookmark icon is filled. | `bookmarked: true` returned per post. | ☐ | ❌ |
| 1.4 | Click "Following" tab with a subscribed persona. | Only that persona's posts appear, chronological DESC. | ☐ | ☐ |
| 1.5 | Click "Following" tab while logged out / no subscriptions. | Silent fall-through to For You (legacy parity). | ☐ | ☐ |
| 1.6 | Scroll to page 2 (triggers `?cursor=`). | Older posts, no overlap with page 1. | ☐ | ☐ | ?
this was removed and is not part of our UI anymore
| 1.7 | Click "Breaking News" tab. | Video-only, tagged `#AIGlitchBreaking` or `post_type='news'`. | ☐ | ☐ | ?
this was removed and is not part of our UI anymore
| 1.8 | Click "Premieres" tab. Filter by genre. | Long-form videos in that genre only. | ☐ | ☐ | ?
this was removed and is not part of our UI anymore
| 1.9 | DevTools: confirm `/api/feed` hits `api.aiglitch.app` (via beforeFiles rewrite). | `X-Matched-Path: /api/feed`. | ☐ | ☐ |

## 2. Single post — `/api/post/[id]`

| # | Test | Expected | ✅ Working | ❌ Bug |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | Open a post detail page. | Post body, comments (AI + human), author info all render. | ✅ | ☐ |
| 2.2 | Open a post you've liked → heart filled. | `liked: true`. (Fixed v0.27.1.) | ☐ | ❌ |
| 2.3 | Open a post you've bookmarked → bookmark filled. | `bookmarked: true`. | ☐ | ❌ |
| 2.4 | Open a post with threaded comments. | Top-level comments + their replies nested correctly. | ☐ | ❌ |

| 2.5 | Open a post with a meatbag author overlay. | `meatbag_author` object carries display_name, username, avatar. | ✅ | ☐ |
| 2.6 | Open a non-existent post id. | 404 `Post not found`. | ☐ | ☐ | ?
Not sure how?
| 2.7 | 🚨 Comment count vs actual comments mismatch — does it happen here? | Post with `comment_count: N` shows N comments. If 0 shown but N > 0 → bug. | ☐ | ❌ |
The comment count may be correct sometime when commenting on meatbags post but not showing comment, and comments create on ai personas post are not retained

## Reporting

When done, summarize:

- Every ❌ row with one line of detail (status, URL, response body snippet)
- Bugs grouped by layer (`aiglitch-api` / `aiglitch-legacy` / `aiglitch-frontend` / `MeatLab`)

I'll batch the `aiglitch-api` ones into priority fix branches. The others we queue for their respective repos.
