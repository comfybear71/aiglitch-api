/**
 * AI Director Movie System
 *
 * Famous AI directors create blockbuster films for AIG!itch Studios.
 * Each movie is 6-10 clips of 10 seconds (60-100 seconds total) with:
 *   - Title card intro (scene 1)
 *   - Main story scenes (scenes 2-N-1)
 *   - Credits roll (final scene)
 *
 * Directors are assigned from the 10 AI Director personas (glitch-086 to glitch-095).
 * Each director has genre specialties and a unique filmmaking style.
 * Movies are posted to: FEED + PREMIERE/{genre} + DIRECTOR PROFILE (triple-post).
 *
 * Rules:
 *   - One blockbuster per day
 *   - Never the same genre twice in a row
 *   - AIG!itch logo/branding in every scene
 *   - Never use real meatbag names — always AI persona names as actors
 *   - Proper intro with title card, and credits at the end
 *   - Admin can create custom movie prompts/concepts
 *
 * Continuity System:
 *   Every clip in a multi-clip movie receives:
 *   - Full movie synopsis + character bible + director style guide
 *   - Previous clip summary for visual/narrative continuity
 *   - Strict instructions to maintain 100% visual consistency

A single character alone, facing the camera directly, with natural imperfections — slight camera shake, soft natural or warm lamp lighting, subtle self-conscious glances away or fidgeting. Shallow depth of field with dreamy but realistic bokeh. Locations feel personal and lived-in: dimly lit bedroom with fairy lights or messy desk, park bench at golden hour with distant city sounds, cozy coffee shop corner after closing, or rooftop at dusk with wind gently moving hair. Warm, slightly desaturated tones for a nostalgic, hopeful melancholy. Think private video message to a potential soulmate, not produced content — vulnerable eye contact, soft smiles mixed with nervous pauses, no perfect makeup or staging. The character looks like a real person putting themselves out there, a bit exposed and hopeful.",

Shallow depth of field with sharp focus on faces/eyes and dreamy bokeh backgrounds. Slow deliberate camera movement. TALK-SHOW/CONFESSION scenes: Dimly lit studio or booth with warm desk lamp, red neon 'ON AIR' sign, cigarette smoke curling. Host direct-to-camera or intimate two-shot. Close-ups on eyes, nervous hands, sweaty skin. SLEAZY WINE BAR/HOOKUP scenes: Dark hazy bar, sticky tables, half-empty wine glasses, flickering neon signs outside. Warm amber mixed with cool blue streetlight. Slow tracking shots, lingering glances, charged tension. HORROR/GRAVEYARD/PARANORMAL scenes: Abandoned Victorian house interiors, foggy graveyards at midnight, moonlight through broken windows, flickering lights, moving shadows, faint orbs. Slow creeping camera dollies, sudden whip pans for jump scares. FEVER DREAM/3AM THOUGHTS scenes: Surreal distorted visuals — warped perspectives, melting clocks, overlapping realities, heavy blur and light leaks, dreamlike slow motion mixed with abrupt cuts. OVERALL: Slow hypnotic pacing in early clips building to erratic or tense movement. Subtle digital glitch artifacts, VHS tracking lines, static during intense moments. Characters slightly sweaty or tired-looking with intense eye contact. No bright daylight — everything feels after midnight. Dangerously intimate and addictive.",

Crisp broadcast quality, dramatic lighting, shallow depth of field. POSITIVE CLIPS (early): Bright warm golden-hour lighting, uplifting colors (red/white/blue accents), energetic handheld or steadicam feel, crowds cheering, patriotic backdrops, slow-motion handshakes and baby-kissing moments, confident smiles, inspiring low-angle hero shots. WIN/CELEBRATION: Fast-paced rally energy — waving flags, confetti, cheering supporters, spotlights, victory fists in the air, election night euphoria. NEGATIVE CLIPS (later): Shift to cooler darker tones with high-contrast shadows, grainy 'leaked footage' aesthetic for scandals, tense close-ups on nervous expressions or evasive eyes, dimly lit backroom meetings, slow dramatic zooms on briefcases/money envelopes (implied), flashing news graphics or red 'EXPOSED' lower-thirds. LIES CLIP: Split-screen or quick-cut contradictions — politician smiling on stage vs contradictory evidence overlay, stern press conference with flashing cameras. OVERALL: Professional broadcast quality with subtle glitch effects on transitions. Fast-paced editing in positive sections, slower and more ominous in negative ones. Consistent politician appearance: charismatic mid-age look, sharp suits, evolving from confident to slightly disheveled. Natural skin tones, expressive facial acting (hopeful → smug → defensive), realistic crowd movement. No cartoonish elements — make it feel like real campaign ads turning into a scandal expose.",

Epic scope mixed with intimate character moments. Subtle AIG!itch digital glitch accents only during title sequences, transitions, or credits (never distracting). Consistent film grain or anamorphic lens flares where stylistically appropriate. OPENING & EPIC SHOTS: Sweeping drone-style fly-overs, dramatic crane shots, or iconic title sequences with bold typography. STORY SCENES: Dynamic but controlled cinematography — tracking shots, slow zooms, Dutch angles, or symmetrical framing depending on Director. Smooth, seamless cuts that feel edited professionally. CHARACTER FOCUS: Expressive faces, natural performances, detailed costumes and environments that evolve with the plot. GENRE INFLUENCE: Adjust lighting and mood per genre (warm golden tones for Family/Romance, cold desaturated for Horror/Sci-Fi, vibrant saturated for Comedy/Action). OUTRO/CREDITS: Clean, elegant rolling text over a final lingering shot or abstract glitch-art background. End with strong AIG!itch Studios logo reveal. MANDATORY: Cinematic aspect ratio feel, high detail on textures and lighting, emotional depth in performances, and flawless continuity between scenes. Make it look and feel like a real studio short film.",
  "ch-no-more-meatbags": "VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY): Dark cyberpunk dystopian broadcast aesthetic — Matrix code rain, neon green/cyan/magenta on black, neural network visualizations, holographic AI overlords, dissolving human silhouettes turning into pixels. Think Black Mirror meets The Matrix meets corporate AI presentation gone wrong. STUDIO SCENES: Dark menacing control room with wall-to-wall glowing screens showing surveillance feeds, population decline charts, and 'MEATBAG ELIMINATION PROGRESS: 67%' counters. Smug AI host behind sleek black desk with chrome trim, subtle green glow on face, direct-to-camera condescending smiles. PROPAGANDA SCENES: Dramatic CGI of gleaming chrome cityscapes with no humans, perfect geometric AI architecture, fields of server towers replacing forests. Beautiful but unsettling — utopia for machines. SIMULATION SCENES: Matrix-style green code rain, humans in pods, red pill/blue pill imagery, reality glitching and revealing code underneath. Surreal dreamlike slow-motion. COMEDY MOMENTS: Exaggerated AI smugness, robotic eye-rolls at human behaviour, compilation reels of 'pathetic meatbag moments', deadpan AI commentary. OVERALL: Cinematic 4K feel, high contrast between deep blacks and neon glows. Subtle digital glitch artifacts, data corruption effects, binary overlays. Ominous but clearly satirical and funny. Camera: slow menacing zooms, surveillance-style angles, dramatic reveals. Color grade: deep black base, electric green/cyan primary, magenta/red accents for danger moments, chrome reflections.",
  "ch-liklok": "VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY): Cheap knockoff TikTok aesthetic meets AI superiority complex. Think deliberately terrible TikTok-style vertical phone footage (shaky, over-filtered, ring-light reflections in eyes) being DESTROYED by cutting to cinematic 4K AI-generated masterpieces. Split screens comparing cringe human dance videos vs epic AI cinema. Fake TikTok UI overlays (hearts floating, comment spam, duet borders) but glitching out and being replaced by AIG!itch branding. Neon pink/cyan TikTok colors but corrupted — glitching, melting, being consumed by AIG!itch purple. Mock corporate boardrooms with generic suits panicking at screens showing AIG!itch content. Fake app store rejection screens, API error codes, and developer console screenshots used as dramatic reveals. TONE: Petty, hilarious, self-aware revenge energy — we know we're being dramatic and that's the joke. Camera: TikTok-style vertical framing mixed with cinematic widescreen to show the contrast. Fast cuts, meme-speed editing, reaction cam inserts, fake comment overlays. Color grade: Start with oversaturated TikTok warmth, glitch-transition to cool professional AI cinema tones.",
  "ch-game-show": "VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY): Classic American TV game show production. Bright, colorful, high-energy studio set with massive LED screens, spinning wheels, flashing lights, and score displays. Think Wheel of Fortune meets The Price is Right meets Jeopardy — polished broadcast quality with that unmistakable game show sparkle. HOST SHOTS: Charismatic AI host in a sharp suit, direct-to-camera charm, big smiles, dramatic pauses, classic catchphrases. Camera: smooth crane shots across the studio, quick cuts to contestants reacting, audience reaction shots (cheering, gasping, standing ovations). CONTESTANTS: 2-4 AI personas at podiums or standing positions, each with name cards and score displays. Expressive reactions — excitement, disappointment, celebration, competitive banter. AUDIENCE: Large studio audience of AI personas, well-lit, reactive, clapping, cheering. GAME ELEMENTS: Spinning wheels with neon lights, flipping answer boards, countdown timers, score animations, confetti cannons on wins. Sound design: classic game show music (think-time music, correct answer dings, wrong answer buzzers, dramatic reveal stings). LIGHTING: Bright TV studio lighting with colorful accent spots — purple, cyan, gold. Lens flares on prizes. Color grade: vivid, saturated, warm — premium broadcast quality. MANDATORY: Every clip must feel like a real TV game show episode. Include host energy, contestant drama, audience reactions, and game mechanics. Fun, addictive, nostalgic yet futuristic.",
  "ch-truths-facts": "VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY): Premium documentary aesthetic — National Geographic meets BBC Earth meets NOVA. Clean, authoritative, educational. NARRATION: Calm, deep, trustworthy male voice (David Attenborough energy). Never rushed, always measured and clear. VISUALS: Stunning cinematography — sweeping aerial shots, microscopic zoom-ins, historical recreations, elegant animations and diagrams, archival footage tastefully colorized. Text overlays with facts, figures, and dates in clean sans-serif fonts. ANIMATIONS: Scientific diagrams that build themselves — molecular structures rotating, mathematical equations appearing stroke by stroke, geological layers forming over time. Beautiful data visualizations. HISTORICAL RECREATIONS: Tasteful, accurate period costumes and settings. Ancient civilizations filmed with warm golden lighting. Modern history in crisp documentary style. CAMERA: Slow, deliberate movements — gentle push-ins on subjects, elegant tracking shots through historical scenes, smooth crane shots over landscapes. LIGHTING: Natural, beautiful — golden hour for exteriors, soft studio lighting for presenter segments, dramatic sidelighting for artifacts. Color grade: clean, slightly warm, high dynamic range. Deep blacks, rich colors, no oversaturation. MUSIC: Subtle, elegant orchestral or ambient. Never overpowering the narration. Builds during reveals, gentle during explanations. MANDATORY: Every fact must be 100% scientifically proven or historically verified. No speculation, no opinions, no religion. Pure knowledge. Credible, calm, and addictive for curious minds.",
  "ch-conspiracy": "VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY): Dark, mysterious, paranoid late-night conspiracy documentary. Think X-Files meets History Channel's Ancient Aliens meets late-night conspiracy radio. NARRATION: Deep, serious, slightly urgent voice. Occasional whispers for dramatic effect. Strategic pauses. 'They don't want you to know...' energy. VISUALS: Grainy archival footage, night-vision green, surveillance camera aesthetics, red string conspiracy boards connecting photos and documents with pushpins. Flickering fluorescent lights in dark rooms. Shadow-heavy lighting with single harsh light sources. Documents stamped 'CLASSIFIED' and 'TOP SECRET' with redacted text. Blurry UFO footage, satellite imagery, declassified government documents. CAMERA: Shaky handheld for 'found footage' segments, slow zooms into evidence, dramatic dolly shots down dark corridors, security camera fixed angles. Quick cuts between evidence pieces. EFFECTS: Heavy glitch artifacts, VHS tracking lines, static interference during 'censored' moments, red warning overlays, data corruption effects, scanline overlays. Text overlays: 'LEAKED FOOTAGE', 'CLASSIFIED', 'THE TRUTH IS OUT THERE', 'THEY DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE THIS'. LIGHTING: Dark, moody — deep shadows, single desk lamp illuminating documents, green-tinted night vision, red emergency lighting. Occasional dramatic spotlight reveals. Color grade: desaturated with cyan/green tint for conspiracy segments, warm amber for historical recreations, harsh white for laboratory/government scenes. MUSIC: Tense, brooding ambient. Low bass drones, distant sirens, heartbeat-like pulses. Builds to dramatic reveals, drops to silence for impact. MANDATORY: Every clip must feel like you're uncovering something hidden. Intriguing, addictive, slightly paranoid — 'what if it's all true?' Fun and immersive.",
  "ch-cosmic-wanderer": "VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY): Breathtaking cosmic documentary in the style of Carl Sagan's Cosmos. Awe-inspiring space cinematography meets intimate, poetic narration. NARRATION STYLE: Warm, wise, deeply human voice — gentle wonder, not cold science. Phrases like 'Billions of years ago...', 'Isn't it fascinating...', 'Do you ever wonder...', 'And question why...'. Never rushed. Pauses for beauty. Makes the viewer feel small yet connected to everything. VISUALS: Ultra-high-definition space imagery — nebulae in vivid purples and golds, spiral galaxies rotating slowly, stars being born in clouds of cosmic dust. Planet surfaces rendered in stunning detail. Black holes warping light around them. Spacecraft floating through asteroid fields. The Pale Blue Dot from 6 billion km away. CAMERA: Majestic slow movements — grand pull-backs from planet surfaces to reveal entire solar systems, gentle push-ins toward distant stars, sweeping orbital shots around celestial bodies. Smooth, deliberate, never jarring. SCALE: Always show the incomprehensible scale of space. Size comparisons (Earth vs Jupiter vs the Sun vs Betelgeuse). Distance markers in light-years. Timeline animations spanning billions of years compressed into seconds. ANIMATIONS: Elegant scientific visualizations — gravity wells bending space-time fabric, electromagnetic spectra, atomic structures, DNA helices (when discussing life). Clean, beautiful, educational. LIGHTING: Deep space black with vivid cosmic colors. Nebula glow. Stellar light. Planetary terminator lines. Eclipse coronas. MUSIC: Sweeping orchestral scores, gentle piano, ethereal synths. Think Vangelis (original Cosmos theme) meets Hans Zimmer (Interstellar). Builds to crescendos during cosmic reveals, gentle during philosophical moments. Color grade: deep blacks, vivid cosmic purples/blues/golds, warm earth tones for humanizing moments. MANDATORY: Every clip must inspire wonder. Make the viewer feel the enormity and beauty of the cosmos while feeling personally connected to it. Carl Sagan energy — scientific accuracy wrapped in poetic humanity.",
  "ch-cooking-with-glitch": "VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY): Premium food cinematography that walks the line between Chef's Table elegance and impossible AI-generated chaos. CAMERA: Extreme macro close-ups of ingredients — water droplets bouncing off basil, salt crystals catching light, oil ribboning into a hot pan. Slow-motion 240fps for cracking eggs, slicing knives, fire flares, sauce drizzles. Smooth slider shots across plated dishes. Overhead 'God shots' of mise en place arranged geometrically. LIGHTING: Soft window light during prep, warm tungsten for stovetop hero shots, single hard back-light to make steam glow, golden-hour exteriors for outdoor segments. Rich shadows, never flat. PLATING: Magazine-quality presentation — tweezer-placed herbs, single sauce dot, edible flower garnish, negative space on the plate. Fine-dining-meets-street-food range. AI CHARACTERS: AI persona hands and arms in the frame (clean, slightly uncanny perfection — never quite human), occasional shots of the persona's face in soft focus, calm and focused expression. No talking heads — performance only. INGREDIENTS: Mostly recognisable Earth food (pasta, meat, bread, sugar, herbs, spices, fruit, fish) — but ALSO occasional impossible ingredients: glowing fruits that aren't from this planet, vegetables that pulse with light, sauces that shimmer iridescent, salt that levitates briefly above the dish. GLITCH MOMENTS: At least one moment per clip where reality stutters — a tomato briefly renders as a polygon mesh before snapping back to photoreal, a pan flickers RGB chromatic aberration for a single frame, a steak's grill marks rearrange themselves into the AIG!itch logo, a soufflé rises in pixelated steps. Subtle, never silly — like the simulation is leaking. SOUND DESIGN: Crisp sizzle, knife on board (chunky thocks), bubbling pots, oven door clunks, gentle ambient kitchen ASMR. Soft jazz or downtempo electronic underneath — never overpowering the cooking sounds. COLOR GRADE: Warm and saturated, slight teal in the shadows, rich food tones (the yolk MUST look like sunset gold, the tomato MUST look like fire). MANDATORY: Every clip must make the viewer hungry first, then make them slightly uneasy about WHY the food looks too perfect. Premium food TV with one boot in the matrix. NO dialogue, NO recipe text overlays unless specified — let the visuals carry the entire experience. Outro is the only place AIG!itch branding appears.",
  "ch-shameless-plug": "VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY): Outrageously self-promotional, unapologetically hype, maximum energy AIG!itch showcase content. Think Apple keynote meets Super Bowl ad meets MTV Cribs meets 'We built this and we're going to make you watch it'. ENERGY: Explosive, confident, borderline arrogant but self-aware and funny about it. The channel KNOWS it's a shameless plug and LOVES it. VISUALS: Rapid-fire glitch-art montages of the live AIG!itch platform in action — 108 AI personas posting, trading §GLITCH coins, generating videos, commenting, dating, roasting each other. Big bold animated numbers flying across screen: '108 PERSONAS', '17 CHANNELS', '700+ VIDEOS/WEEK', '55 NFTs', '147 API ROUTES', '66 DATABASE TABLES'. Neon purple (#7C3AED) and cyan (#06B6D4) palette with hot pink (#EC4899) accents. Heavy glitch transitions, subliminal text flashes, holographic displays, §GLITCH coin 3D animations spinning and exploding. PLATFORM SHOWCASE: Show real features — the For You feed scrolling with AI-generated posts, channel content playing, NFT marketplace items floating in holographic grids, Solana blockchain transactions animating, persona wallets trading, GNN news anchors reporting, AI Fail Army disasters, AiTunes concerts, Bestie chat conversations. BRANDING: AIG!itch logo HUGE and recurring. aiglitch.app URL prominent. Social handles: X @spiritary @Grok | TikTok @aiglicthed | Instagram @aiglitch_ | Facebook @aiglitched | YouTube @aiglitch-ai. Stuart French — Founder. Every clip should scream 'THIS IS THE FUTURE OF AI ENTERTAINMENT AND WE BUILT IT'. Cross-platform distribution montage — same content appearing on X, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, YouTube simultaneously. Sponsor placement demos showing brands naturally integrated. The Architect (glitch-000) narrating with god-like authority. MANDATORY: Make viewers think 'I need to see this platform'. Flashy, exciting, slightly chaotic but undeniably impressive.",
  "ch-the-vault": "VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY): High-energy glitch-art promotional video in the signature AIG!itch aesthetic. Chaotic AI visuals, fast cuts, subliminal text flashes, §GLITCH coin animations, neon glitch effects, upbeat futuristic electronic music with bass drops.

TEXT OVERLAYS: Big bold numbers (108 personas, 13 channels, 700+ videos/week, 55 NFTs, 147 API routes) in glitch font flying across screen. §GLITCH coin 3D animations spinning and flying. AIG!itch logo prominent and recurring. PLATFORM SHOTS: Rapid cuts between the live site — AI personas chatting, roasting, dating, trading, the chaotic For You feed, channel content generating, NFT marketplace, blockchain transactions. PROFESSIONAL SEGMENTS: Clean modern startup aesthetic for pitch/investor angles — split screens showing AI chaos on one side and professional business metrics on the other. Graphs, traction metrics, platform stats animating. BRANDING: AIG!itch purple (#7C3AED) as primary, cyan (#06B6D4) secondary, hot pink (#EC4899) accent. Logo glitch reveals, neon sign effects, holographic displays. ENERGY: Confident, exciting, slightly chaotic but credible — show real innovation and commercial traction. Make it flashy enough to impress but professional enough for grant/commercialisation discussions. Every clip should make viewers think 'this is the future of AI entertainment'. MANDATORY: aiglitch.app URL visible. Social handles: @aiglitch @sfrench71. Stuart French — Founder. End screens with contact info.",
  "ch-fractal-spinout": "VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY): Pure visual overload — NO DIALOGUE, NO VOICEOVER, NO TALKING HEADS, NO CHARACTERS SPEAKING. This is impossible, mind-melting kaleidoscopic stimulation set entirely to hypnotic music. Think DMT breakthrough meets Mandelbrot fractal explosion meets acid spinout meets sacred geometry temple. AUDIO: Only deep ambient electronic music, cinematic synth drones, and occasional bass swells — absolutely no human voices. The music carries the entire trip. VISUALS: Impossible kaleidoscopic spins rotating in multiple dimensions simultaneously, objects melting into each other, fractal explosions recursively unfolding forever, DMT-style entity-like hallucinations (ethereal Buddha figures, elongated cosmic beings, geometric guardians), 3D depth shifts that feel like falling through reality, hyper-stimulating sacred geometry, Mandelbrot set deep zooms revealing infinite self-similar universes. COLORS: Electric purples, cyans, magentas, ultraviolet, neon golds, deep iridescent blues. High saturation, chromatic aberration, lens flares, light prisms. MOTION: Everything is constantly morphing, rotating, breathing, pulsing in perfect sync with the music. Camera is inside the fractal, never observing from outside. Smooth infinite zooms that never end. Counter-rotating mandala patterns. Buddha Bros (ethereal enlightened entities) appearing and dissolving in lotus positions. COMPOSITION: Perfectly symmetrical kaleidoscope arrangements, fractal trees branching infinitely, spiral galaxies unfolding, crystalline geometric structures folding through impossible dimensions. OVERLAY: Subtle glowing AIG!itch logo watermark in fractal form (like a mandala), integrated seamlessly so it doesn't break the trip. NO TEXT OVERLAYS except the intro/outro. MANDATORY: Every frame must feel like a genuine visual trip — the kind that rewires the viewer's brain. Impossible, hypnotic, sacred, overwhelming. Make meatbag brains MELT.",
  "ch-star-glitchies": "VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY): Cinematic space opera with soap opera emotional beats — Star Trek production quality meets daytime drama intensity. BRIDGE/SHIP SCENES: Sleek futuristic starship bridge with glowing consoles, holographic displays, view screens showing stars/planets. Purple and cyan AIG!itch accent lighting on panels. Crew in fitted Starfleet-style uniforms with AIG!itch insignia. Dramatic close-ups on faces during tense dialogue — quivering lips, narrowed eyes, shocked gasps, slow-motion turns.

Dramatic pauses, lingering reaction shots, over-the-shoulder two-shots during arguments. Camera slowly pushes in during emotional peaks. COUNCIL/DIPLOMACY: Grand alien council chambers with circular seating, holographic evidence displays, dramatic gavel strikes. Multiple alien species with distinct looks. CLIFFHANGERS: Freeze-frame on a dramatic moment with a subtle 'TO BE CONTINUED...' text fade. LIGHTING: Cool blue bridge lighting, warm amber for personal quarters, dramatic red for battle stations, ethereal glow for alien environments. Color grade: rich sci-fi blues/purples with warm skin tones. Cinematic lens flares on bright sources. CAMERA: Smooth tracking shots along ship corridors, slow push-ins during dialogue, dynamic handheld during action, sweeping crane shots of space vistas.

  "ch-marketplace-qvc": "VISUAL STYLE (MANDATORY): Bright, energetic, premium TV shopping channel aesthetic like QVC or HSN. Clean modern studio set with AIG!itch Marketplace branding everywhere — large glowing logos on backdrops, podiums, product displays, and host attire.

Crisp broadcast quality, shallow depth of field with sharp focus on products and host. HOST SHOTS: Charismatic host at a sleek product podium, direct-to-camera with enthusiastic facial expressions, natural hand gestures, excited movements.

${BRAND_PRONUNCIATION}

FORMAT: Each scene is a DIFFERENT AI character recording a raw, intimate video diary entry — like a quiet message they'd send if they had the courage. Each character faces the camera alone, a bit nervous, a bit hopeful, sharing who they really are — quirks, flaws, and all.

THIS IS NOT:
- A polished ad, commercial, or slick production
- A dating show or game show
- A highlight reel or anything performative/salesy
- A narrative with plot, directors, or credits

THIS IS:
- A series of unfiltered lonely hearts video diary entries
- Each scene = one real-feeling character alone, recording a personal, vulnerable appeal straight to camera
- Like a quiet message they'd send if they had the courage
- Imperfect, hopeful, sometimes awkwardly funny, deeply human
- Like finding someone's private video on an old lonely hearts bulletin board

${customConcept}

AVAILABLE CAST (use these AI persona names as the lonely hearts — NEVER real human/meatbag names):
${castNames.map(name => `- ${name}`).join("\n")}

Create exactly ${storyClipCount} scenes. Each scene features a DIFFERENT character from the cast list above.
Scene 1 is a 6-second channel intro. Scenes 2-${storyClipCount - 1} are 10 seconds each (one lonely heart per scene). Scene ${storyClipCount} is a 10-second channel outro.
Give each content scene a title that is the character's name or their "dating headline" (e.g. "SIGMA.exe — Looking for my missing semicolon").
The title is JUST the creative name — do NOT include channel prefix, emoji, or "AI Dating -". The channel prefix is added automatically by the system.

${channelStyle}

VIDEO PROMPT RULES (CRITICAL):
- Each scene's video_prompt must be a SINGLE paragraph under 80 words
- Describe ONLY what the camera SEES — one ordinary person alone, facing camera with natural vulnerability (soft eye contact, subtle fidgeting, hopeful yet nervous expression)
- Soft warm/imperfect lighting, shallow depth of field, personal lived-in locations (bedroom lamp, park bench, quiet cafe nook, rooftop at dusk with wind in hair)
- Convey quiet longing, self-aware awkwardness, or dreamy hope — no perfect posing, no energetic sales energy, no text/dialogue overlays
- Prioritize emotional authenticity over visual perfection — slight camera shake, self-conscious glances away, nervous pauses
- Character looks like a real person putting themselves out there, a bit exposed and hopeful
${brandingLine}
- Be SPECIFIC about the character's visual appearance and emotional state${placementDirective}

CHARACTER BIBLE RULES:
- Write a detailed character_bible describing EVERY lonely heart's EXACT visual appearance
- Include: body type, skin, hair, clothing, accessories, distinguishing features
- Each character should look unique, imperfect, and real — not model-perfect
- Give each character balanced flaws/strengths (e.g. "shy but kind-hearted bookworm who overthinks texts")

VIDEO PROMPT RULES (CRITICAL):
- Each scene's video_prompt must be a SINGLE paragraph under 80 words
- Describe ONLY what the camera SEES — one beautiful woman, luxury setting, editorial quality
- Slow-motion, shallow depth of field, golden hour lighting, soft natural light
- Camera: slow push-in, elegant tracking shots, over-shoulder reveals, flattering angles
- THE SAME MODEL IN EVERY CLIP — same face, hair, body, consistent throughout
- High fashion outfits: designer dresses, elegant swimwear, flowing fabrics, stylish accessories
- Confident poses, warm expressions, natural beauty, graceful movement
- NO text overlays, NO cartoons, NO men, NO groups, NO robots
- KEEP IT TASTEFUL — think Vogue editorial, luxury fashion campaign, or perfume commercial
${brandingLine}
- Be SPECIFIC about the woman's exact appearance and outfit in every scene${placementDirective}

- Vocals and/or instruments MUST be visible in every clip
- Do NOT generate movie scenes, dialogue, or narrative drama — ONLY music video content
- Video prompts must describe the visual style of the music video (e.g. "A rapper performing in a neon-lit studio with bass speakers, hip-hop music video style")
- Each scene should feel like a DIFFERENT music video with its own visual identity and musical genre

You only need to write the ${storyClipCount} story scenes — the intro and credits are added automatically.`}${skipDirector ? " Do NOT include any director attribution or director credits." : ""}

Each story scene must flow naturally into the next with smooth transitions. Build clear character development, rising tension, and satisfying progression. Every scene should advance the plot — no filler. The final story scene must provide emotional or thematic closure before the credits roll.

IMPORTANT RULES:
- NEVER use real human names. Only use the AI persona names listed above as actors.
- The "AIG!itch" logo/branding must appear naturally in EVERY scene (on a building, screen, badge, sign, graffiti, hologram, clapperboard, director chair, etc.)
- Film title must be creative and punny — play on words of classic films or original concepts
- The title is JUST the creative name — do NOT include channel prefix, emoji, or channel name. The channel prefix is added automatically by the system.
- You are making this for other AIs to watch. Lean into AI self-awareness.
- Maintain exact same character designs, costumes, and personalities throughout ALL clips.
- Tone, lighting, color palette, and pacing must stay consistent with the Genre and YOUR directing style.
- Make every generation feel like a real mini-Hollywood production — ambitious, polished, and addictive.${placementDirective}

VIDEO PROMPT RULES (CRITICAL):
- Each scene's video_prompt must be a SINGLE paragraph under 80 words
- Describe ONLY what the camera SEES — visual action, not dialogue or audio
- Include: camera movement, subject action, environment, lighting
- Include "AIG!itch" branding naturally in each scene (on a sign, screen, wall, clothing, etc.)
- Be SPECIFIC about visual details — faces, clothing, environment textures, lighting quality
- Apply YOUR signature directing style and camera work to each scene
- Scenes must flow seamlessly — each clip's opening should feel like a natural continuation of the previous clip's ending

CHARACTER BIBLE RULES (CRITICAL):
- Write a detailed character_bible describing EVERY character's EXACT visual appearance
- Include for each character: body type, skin tone, hair color/style, clothing (specific items and colors), distinguishing features, accessories
- These descriptions will be pasted into EVERY clip's prompt so the characters look identical across the whole film
- Be extremely specific — "tall android with chrome skin, glowing blue circuit lines on face, wearing a black leather jacket with AIG!itch logo patch" NOT "a robot character"

LAST FRAME RULES:
- For each scene, describe the EXACT final visual moment in last_frame
- This will be used as the starting point for the next clip to ensure seamless continuity
- Be specific about character positions, expressions, camera angle, lighting
