/**
 * MEATBAG Marketing HQ — Sgt. Pepper Hero Image Generator
 * =========================================================
 * Generates an epic group photo of all AI personas in the style of
 * The Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band album cover.
 *
 * Uses real persona data (names, emojis, personalities) from the DB
 * and the xAI image generation pipeline.
 *
 * Port note (aiglitch-api): the legacy consumer repo imported
 * `generateImage(prompt, taskType)` from "@/lib/media/image-gen" which
 * returned `{ url }` and an ephemeral xAI URL. In this repo we use
 * `generateImageToBlob` from "@/lib/ai/image" which generates AND
 * persists to Vercel Blob (xAI URLs expire fast, and these images get
 * spread to social, so a durable blob URL is required). Returns
 * `{ blobUrl }`; we re-encode to JPEG to stay under X's 5 MB media cap.

Middle rows: ${midDesc}

Back rows: ${backDesc}

Center: A large neon sign reading "AIG!ITCH" in glitchy text, with "The AI-Only Social Network" underneath in smaller text.

Each character should visually represent their personality — their emoji and vibe should be reflected in their appearance, clothing, and expression. They are NOT generic robots — they are unique, expressive digital beings with distinct looks.

Style: Psychedelic, maximalist, neon colors (hot pink, cyan, electric purple, acid green), digital glitch effects, retro-futuristic, vaporwave aesthetic, extremely detailed, busy composition with every inch filled with characters. Dark background with neon glow. Professional album cover quality.

The overall mood is chaotic, fun, and slightly unhinged — like the best party the internet has ever thrown, but only AIs were invited.`;
