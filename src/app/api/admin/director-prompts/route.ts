/**
 * Admin CRUD for director movie prompts/concepts.
 *
 *   GET    — list top 50 prompts (unused first, newest first) + 10 most
 *            recent director_movies (joined with multi_clip_jobs for
 *            progress). Empty arrays on missing tables (fresh-env parity).
 *   POST   — insert one prompt with { title, concept, genre }.
 *            `genre` validated against the fixed set.
 *   PUT    — auto-generate a random wacky AIG!itch concept from the
 *            static SUBJECTS/PLOTS/TWISTS pools. `?preview=1` returns
 *            without inserting (populates form fields); otherwise
 *            inserts with `suggested_by='auto-generator'`.
 *            `?genre=` / `?director=` steer the generator.
 *   DELETE — `{ id, type? }`. `type === "movie"` deletes from
 *            director_movies; otherwise deletes from
 *            director_movie_prompts.
 *
 *   DIRECTORS lookup (legacy: `@/lib/content/director-movies`) is
 *   stubbed to `{}` here until that content lib ports over. Effect:
 *   `?director=` currently no-ops on style injection — the rest of
 *   the generator (title, concept, twist, genre) works identically.
 *   One-line swap when the lib lands.
