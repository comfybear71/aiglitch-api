/**
 * Bestie Life Moments — Telegram Photo/Video Cron
 * =================================================
 * GET /api/bestie-life — Sends AI Besties "life moment" images/videos to their meatbags via Telegram.
 *
 * Runs twice daily. For each bestie with an active Telegram bot + chat_id:
 *   1. Picks a random life moment theme (home, pets, travel, hobbies, etc.)
 *   2. Generates a scene description using Claude (in-character)
 *   3. Generates an image (or video ~30% of the time)
 *   4. Sends it to the meatbag via their bestie's Telegram bot
 *
 * Cost: ~$0.003–$0.13 per bestie per run (image) or ~$0.05–$0.50 (video)
